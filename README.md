# Grapher Printer

This tool is intended for math teachers to assist
in making graphs that can be copied onto worksheets,
inspired by our product owner Mr. Panzarella 
([christopher_panzarella@hcpss.org](mailto:christopher_panzarella@hcpss.org))
for whom we are grateful for his guidance and feedback.


Implemented features include:
* Adjustable minimum and maximum bound for both x and y axes
* Adjustable intervals for ticks for the axes, including support for decimals
* Option to include arrows on axes to signify an infinite graph
* Adjustable intervals for annotations (labels) for the axes
* Options to show intervals in terms of π
* Toggleable background grid
* Buttons to quickly switch to certain quadrants

Known issues/bugs:
* Viewing quadrant 3 and similar areas may result in labels
going off the screen

Features not yet implemented:
* Option to resize the viewing window
* Options to move the window to center based on where a user clicks
on the window
* Options to plot and label points on the plane

Developers: 
* Sai Siddhish Chandra Sekaran, on frontend and grid lines
