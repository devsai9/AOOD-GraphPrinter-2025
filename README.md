# Graph Printer
<ins>**Graph printer for teachers**</ins>

Graph Printer is a tool that can be used by math teachers in order to display or print graphs that can be copied onto worksheets or projected during class for their students. The window and ticks can be adjusted, and there are also options to customize the graph, including support for units in terms of pi. Simply adjust settings and save the graph to be used on any worksheet.

This tool was nspired by our product owner Mr. Panzarella ([christopher_panzarella@hcpss.org](mailto:christopher_panzarella@hcpss.org)) for whom we are grateful for his guidance and feedback.

The tool can be accessed at [https://graphprinter-14363081.codehs.me/index.html](https://graphprinter-14363081.codehs.me/index.html).

Implemented features include:
* Two panels, one where the adjustable settings and the other where the graph is created
* Adjustable minimum and maximum bound for both x and y axes
* Adjustable intervals for ticks for the axes, including support for decimals
* Option to include arrows on axes to signify an infinite graph
* Adjustable intervals for annotations (labels/tick labels) for the axes
* Customizable x and y axis labels
* Options to show intervals in terms of Ï€
* Toggleable background grid
* Buttons to quickly switch to certain quadrants
* Changing font size of labels
* The website does not allow window to be so small the graph is unreadable

Known issues/bugs:
* Viewing quadrant 3 and similar areas may result in labels
going off the screen
* If there are too many ticks then the number labels will overlap each other

Features not yet implemented:
* Option to resize the viewing window
* Options to move the window to center based on where a user clicks
on the window
* Options to plot and label points on the plane

Developers: 
* Sai Siddhish Chandra Sekaran, on frontend and grid lines
* Albert Cao, on moving axes, radian and tick labels
* Tommy Diep, on arrows and axes labels
* Emily Wu, on frontend, quadrant jumping and label/arrow alignment

All developers contributed equally to the project.

Developed as part of Centennial High School's Advanced Object-Oriented Design GT Class.
